<h3> Hello, iXperience </h3>

<p> My name is Rachel Rub! I am so excited to spend my summer in South Africa with you all. </p>

<p> As you can probably tell, this is my first time ever even attempting to code. I am having a lot of fun and am learning a lot. </p>

<p>I can't wait to learn even more this summer!</p>
